SUDOKU HELPER

by 

F. Lauffenburger and D. Tran


Installation:

Eiffelmedia is required. If Eiffelmedia is not installed the game will not run. Download Eiffelmedia at http://eiffelmedia.origo.ethz.ch/

To install just unzip the binary into a directory and double click on the EXE file. Simple!



Playing:

Fill in what you know from the puzzle. If you click on HELP you will get a list of numbers that can be filled in by logical deduction. Clicking on solve will immediatly solve the puzzle completely.



Known issues:

Clicking on solve when no complete solution is available, then filling in some more numbers and clicking on solve again CAN (and most likely will) cause unpredictable results!

New button is acting up sometimes. (should be fixed!)

If you find a SUDOKU that the brain can’t solve, yet you can and you are 100% sure you didn’t mistype, I’d be interested in looking at it. (lauffenf@student.ethz.ch)
